# Productivity Painter
Don't waist your lovely thoughts feeling concerned that people judge your github productivity chart. **Make it something cool!!**

Paint holiday and mental health breaks with colorful patterns and generally make anything look like whatever you like. You're doing a great job just being you in this world, and that isn't easy, so keep your head up. <3

We're using Annihil's [github-spray](https://github.com/Annihil/github-spray) cli tool.

Example usage
```github-spray --multiplier 10 --startdate 2019-11-24 -f patterns/quilt-patch.json --push --origin https://github.com/Elisabot/productivity-painter```
