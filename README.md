# Productivity Painter
Don't waist your lovely thoughts feeling concerned that people are judging your github productivity chart. **Make something cool!!**

Paint holiday and mental health breaks with colorful patterns and generally make anything look like whatever you like. You're doing a great job just being you in this world, and that isn't easy, so keep your head up. <3

We're using Annihil's [github-spray](https://github.com/Annihil/github-spray) cli tool.

## How Do I Do This Again?
install the cli tool <br>
`npm i -g github-spray`

make a repo, push it to github, and *fubar* its' commit history <br>
`github-spray --multiplier 10 --startdate 2019-11-24 -f patterns/example.json --push --origin https://github.com/Elisabot/your-repo-name.git`

now you get a generated submodule, and you're gonna wanna add that as a remote and merge that into your main project then remove the remote and push the whole darn thing up to Github. it felt dirty and I didn't like it, but it worked and I think I'll do it differently next time.
